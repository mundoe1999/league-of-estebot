# League of Estebot
League of Estebot is the final project for my Web Programming 
(MEDP 34100) for Hunter College. This is a simple simulation where 
a player is able to experience a series of events that one would 
typically expect in a "League of Legends" match, and you must 
select the choices in order to win your match!

As part of my 2025 github "Shine and Scrub" initiative, I have 
decided to take a look back at all my previous project and perform
enhancements, optimizations, and reworks based on my newfound experience.

For the League of Estebot project, these are my goals:
- [ ] Rework success/failure algorithm for events.
- [ ] Improve overall simulation flow to allow further engagement, strategizing, and repeatibility.
- [ ] Clean UI Experience to allow additional interactivity and thematic cohesion.
- [ ] Improve code readability and performance.

In order to maintain the spirit of the original project, I will ensure this application remains as closely vanilla Javascript as possible. This means no react/angular and only using the minimum amount of libraries required to ensure this project is able to run as-is.
